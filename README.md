* Operators
* Control flow
* Functions
* Arrays
*
 Pointers
* Structures
* File I/O
## What is C programming?
C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language. It was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. C is a very powerful language that can be used to develop a wide variety of applications, including operating systems, embedded systems, and desktop applications. It is also a relatively easy language to learn, making it a good choice for beginners.
## Setting up your development environment
To start programming in C, you will need a text editor and a C compiler. There are many different text editors and C compilers available. Some popular text editors include VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom and Vim. Some popular C compilers include GCC, Clang, and MSVC.
If you are using Project IDX, you already have a text editor and a C compiler available to you. You can use the built-in terminal to compile and run your C programs. More information on how to use Project IDX is available [here](https://developers.google.com/idx/guides/introduction).
## Your first C program
Here is a simple C program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console:


c #include <stdio.h>

int main() { printf("Hello, world!\n"); return 0; }

To compile and run this program, save it as a file named `hello.c` and then run the following command in your terminal:


bash gcc hello.c -o hello ./hello

This will compile the program and create an executable file named `hello`. When you run the executable file, it will print "Hello, world!" to the console.
## Basic syntax
C programs are written in a text file with a `.c` extension. The basic syntax of a C program is as follows:


c #include <header_file.h>

int main() { // Your code here return 0; }

The `#include` directive is used to include header files, which contain declarations for functions and variables that are used in the program. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. The code inside the `main()` function is executed when the program is run.
## Data types
C has a variety of data types, including:
* `int`: integers
* `float`: floating-point numbers
* `char`: characters
* `double`: double-precision floating-point numbers
## Operators
C has a variety of operators, including:
* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
* Relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
* Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
* Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
## Control flow
C has a variety of control flow statements, including:
* `if` statement
* `else` statement
* `while` loop
* `do-while` loop
* `for` loop
* `switch` statement
## Functions
Functions are blocks of code that can be called from other parts of the program. Functions can be used to perform specific tasks, such as calculating the sum of two numbers or printing a message to the console.
## Arrays
Arrays are collections of data of the same type. Arrays can be used to store lists of numbers, strings, or other data.
## Pointers
Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. Pointers can be used to access and manipulate data stored in memory.
## Structures
Structures are collections of data of different types. Structures can be used to represent complex data structures, such as records in a database.
## File I/O
File I/O is the process of reading and writing data to files. C provides a variety of functions for performing file I/O.
## Conclusion
This is just a brief overview of the basics of C programming. There is much more to learn about C, but this should give you a good starting point. If you are interested in learning more about C programming, there are many resources available online and in libraries.
